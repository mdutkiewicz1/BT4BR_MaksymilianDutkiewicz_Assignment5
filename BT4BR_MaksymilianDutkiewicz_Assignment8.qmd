## Short reminder:

### Initial bad plot

![](chart.png)

### Why was it bad?

**It's usually ill-advised to use pie charts, because humans aren't very good at comparing angles and surfaces. We can't precisely infer any exact values from this bar.**

### Proposed fix

**We'll use bar chart to show the same ratio of effectiveness between current and emerging biomarkers**

### Disclaimer

**Exact dataset with effectiveness measurements was not found. Instead plotdigitizer was used to find precise fractions.**

## Creating new plot:

### Loading data

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
plot_data <- read_csv("plot-data.csv")
```

### Initializing the plot

```{r}
p <-ggplot(data = plot_data, aes(x=category, y=value))
```

### Plotting the bar chart

```{r}
p <- p+geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill=category)) #fills bars based on biomarker category

p
```

### Adding labels

```{r}
p <- p+labs(title="Current and emerging biomarkers in pancreatic cancer",
       subtitle="Effectiveness comparision*",
       x="Biomarker category",
       y="Potential for early detection",
       caption="*based on sensitivity and specificity")
p
```

### Improving aesthetics

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)

p <- p+theme_minimal(base_size = 13)+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
p
```

### Removing redundant legend

```{r}
p <- p+guides(fill = "none")
p
```
